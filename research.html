    <h2>Everglades History</h2>
    <p>The Florida Everglades is a rain-fed series of lakes, rivers, and wetlands and covered almost 3 million acres. They flow from just below Orlando through Lake Okeechobee and south to the tip of the Florida peninsula, expanding east and west towards the coasts. Over the last hundred years, we have dug canals and built dams to tank water to develop agriculture and build homes; This has drained so much water that it has interrupted the natural flow reducing this once vast ecosystem of 3 million acres to a mere 1,800 miles. As the twentieth century dawned, dredging of the Everglades was a smart and progressive thing to do, though by early conservationists.</p>

    <h3>Disturbing The Flow</h3>
    <p>With the natural flow of the Everglades interrupted with canals and dams breaking it up and water control points and dump stations diverting the natural flow of water to coastal towns and cities, the Everglades is a fraction of its original size.  Most often water must be released to prevent flooding, forcing Florida to have too much water in the wet seasons and not enough in the dry seasons.</p>

    <p>Predictions, sixty years ago, anticipated the population in South Florida to reach two million by the 21st century. As of today, South Florida has reached seven million and is expected to double in the next 50 years. With the extreme growth that South Florida has seen over the last 100 years, also come various types of pollution. Shallow levels of nutrients, such as phosphorus, are what make the Everglades a thriving environment for such things as sawgrass, tree islands, and open water. Although, with the nutrient pollution coming from agricultural runoff and other fertilizers, allows invasive species that upset the balance of the ecosystem. </p>

    <h3>Invasion!</h3>
    <p>Over the years we have seen invasive plants such as cattails, harmful algal blooms, and duckweed. Also, the chemical processes lead to toxic mercury in fish, birds, reptiles, and mammals, such as the endangered Florida panther. Exotic plants and animals have also become a threat. Over the years such creatures as the Burmese python, exotic plants, such as Brazillian pepper and Austrailian pine have displaced natives and threaten the balance of the ecosystem.</p>
