      <p>The Everglades ecosystem is facing a serious threat! The byproducts
        from agriculture, development, and overpopulation of invasive species
        are destroying the once massive and vibrant Everglades. Follow the
        journey to see the beauty of the Everglades and what we can do to help
        this very critical ecosystem.</p>

      <h2 id="title">Interdependent Ecosystem</h2>
      <p id="content">The Everglades is a diverse ecosystem of tropical
        wetlands in south Florida. The systems originate from the Kissimmee
        River in the central region of Florida. The river system runs off into
        Lake Okeechobee.This is where the main source of fresh water enters the
        Everglades. The Everglades is composed of complex ecosystems such as
        Cypress Swamps, Mangrove Tree Systems, and Hardwood Hammocks. There is
        also a vast array of weather patterns that range from drought in the dry
        season <em>December - April</em> and flooding during the wet seasons
        <em>May - November</em></p>

        <h2 id="title">Ecosystem in Danger!</h2>
        <p id="content">This fantastic ecosystem and diverse domain
          for wildlife is in grave danger. For centuries people have
          been building architecture such as dams, canals,
          agricultural development and the construction of homes.
          Due to the demand of expansion and growth, the Everglades
          has suffered dramatically, and it's only going to get worse
          if we don't do something to support conservation effort.
          The Everglades was once a massive ecosystem but it is slowly
          depleting, and we must do our best to maintain it.</p>
